AGROX is a comprehensive application aimed at addressing the challenges faced by cinnamon planters. The application provides a one-stop solution for the industry, offering comprehensive guidance and support for ideal growing conditions, planting, and harvesting procedures. One of the key features of AGROX is its ability to tackle pest and disease management, specifically, rough bark disease [1]. The application leverages the latest advances in visual computing to provide suggestions for disease control, thereby ensuring the health of the cinnamon plants. In addition, AGROX also aims to enhance market information and quality assurance for cinnamon through its image processing capabilities [2]. This enables the determination of cinnamon grade, providing a more informed market for both planters and consumers. Another key advantage of AGROX is its community platform and trained virtual assistant [3]. Unlike traditional methods such as Facebook apps, the information provided in AGROX is approved to guarantee accuracy. This reduces the risk of false information spread and provides a more reliable source of information for the industry. In conclusion, AGROX is a game-changer for the cinnamon industry. Its comprehensive approach to growing conditions, pest and disease management, market information, and support, make it a valuable tool for cinnamon planters. The application's commitment to accuracy and reliability sets it apart from traditional methods, providing a more trustworthy source of information for the industry.

Nature of the solution:
The AGROX app is a comprehensive solution designed to provide guidance and support to individuals and organizations involved in the cinnamon industry. The app offers a range of information on various aspects of cinnamon cultivation, such as ideal growing conditions, planting and harvesting procedures, pest (specifically, Cinnamon butterfly) and disease management (more specifically, rough bark disease), market information, and quality assurance support. Additionally, the AGROX app includes a community platform and a trained bot to provide additional support to cinnamon cultivators.The community platform provides a space for cinnamon cultivators to connect, share their experiences, and ask for advice from more experienced individuals. The trained virtual assistant can assist with answering questions and providing information on a variety of topics related to cinnamon cultivation, including the early and accurate diagnosis of rough bark disease. The inclusion of real-time weather forecasts in the app can help cinnamon cultivators make informed decisions about when to care for their plants, optimizing the growth and productivity of their crops.Overall, the AGROX app provides a comprehensive solution to the challenges faced by cinnamon cultivators, helping to ensure their success and promote the growth of the cinnamon industry.
